## Projects
### 1. [Supermarket Application](https://github.com/Sayed-Afnan-Khazi/Supermarket-App)
  Worked on making a comprehensive supermarket application, including all aspects from checkout & billing (POS), inventory & stock management (Including restock warnings), employee details, pay and attendance management.
  -Coded in Python and interfaced with MySQL for Database management.
What I learned from doing this project:
  - General idea of how multiple python scripts interact and creating my own modules with various functionality for the application.
  - Creating a basic login interface with different user profiles that have different options (i.e. "Admin" for the employer and "Employee" for the employees)
  - Validating data and exchanging it back and forth between a python script and database.
  - Working with different types of files (csv, binary,text and others)
  - Creating an easy way for the project to be run on other machines by saving MySQL credentials in an env file.
