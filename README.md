## Projects
### 1. [Supermarket Application](https://github.com/Sayed-Afnan-Khazi/Supermarket-App)
  Worked on making a comprehensive supermarket application, including all aspects from __checkout & billing__ (POS), __inventory & stock management__ (Including restock warnings), __employee details__, __pay and attendance management__.
  
  - Coded in __Python__ and interfaced with __MySQL__ for Database management.
What I learned from doing this project:
  - General idea of how __multiple__ python scripts interact and creating my own __modules__ with various functionality for the application.
  - Creating a basic __login interface__ with __different user profiles__ that have different options (i.e. "Admin" for the employer and "Employee" for the employees)
  - Validating data and exchanging it back and forth between a python script and database.
  - Working with different types of files (csv, binary,text and others)
  - Creating an easy way for the project to be run on other machines by saving MySQL credentials in an env file.
### 2. [Black Jack Card Game](https://github.com/Sayed-Afnan-Khazi/BlackJack-Card-Game)
  Coding project to recreate the card game "Blackjack" with one user playing against the computer.
  - This is one of the first projects where I __extensively used OOP__ (Object Oriented Programming) to make the game possible.
  - It's a simple yet very fun and engaging game that I created as a milestone project for my Python Bootcamp course.
